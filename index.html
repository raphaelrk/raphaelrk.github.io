      <div class="quote">"If the technology you do isnâ€™t
    fun for you, you may wish to seek other employment. Without the fun, none of us

      <!-- Only open your mouth if what you have to say is more beautiful than silence -->

      <!-- Do not spoil what you have by desiring what you have not; remember that what you now have was once among the things you only hoped for. -->

      <!-- Arguing you don't care about privacy because you have nothing to hide is like saying you don't care about free speech because you have nothing to say -->

      <!-- I used to think the worst thing in life was to end up all alone, it's not. The worst thing in life is to end up with people who make you feel alone -->

      <!-- Sometime, when you least expect it, you'll realize that someone loved you. And that means that someone can love you again! And that'll make you smile. -->

      <!-- To summarize: it i a well-known fact that those people who must want to rule people are, ipso facto, those least suited to do it. To summarize the summary: anyone who is capable of getting themselves made President should on no account be allowed to do the job -->

      <!-- Some people die at 25 and aren't buried until 75 -->
